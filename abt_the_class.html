     <h6>Her essay “<a href="houser.pdf">Hidden Figures: Women Telling a Dead Man’s Story</a>” compares Lydia Millet’s A Children's Bible to the musical Hamilton to display the similarities between Eve and Eliza Hamilton. Both of these women have devoted some portion of their lives to tell a loved one's story after they have died. While some may view Eve as the main character of Millet’s novel, I point out that she in fact is not, and this story is instead about Jack and his journey. NOTES: FIX PDF LINK</h6>

          <h6>A child’s psychological development can be harmed in an instant if not treated carefully. Psychology for anyone can be affected by toxic families, early childhood traumas, and even changed to the environment.
