    <h2><img src="Images/bookcover.jpg" width="470px"; height="570px"; class="center"; padding-left: 400px;> <br> <br> <br>A Children's Bible is a climate fiction novel by Lydia Millet that documents the experience of a group of children in the face of climate change as their parents fail to respond to a climate-charged hurricane.</h2> 
    
    <h2>Eve, the novel's narrator, belongs to a group of children staying at a large, rented estate with their parents for the summer. The children, mostly disgusted by their parents' hedonistic behavior, spend most of their time on the property of the estate, until a hurricane interrupts their activities. The parents are never named, and the book filters their activities through the perception of Eve and the other children.</h2>

     <h3>Writing About Literature</h3>
        
        <h2>Welcome to our critical casebook on Lydia Millet’s novel A Children’s Bible. This casebook was crafted by Millikin University students enrolled in Dr. Tony R. Magagna’s English 202: Writing About Literature course during the Fall 2021 semester. Although A Children’s Bible has enjoyed incredible critical acclaim since its publication in 2020, including being <a href="https://www.nationalbook.org/2020-national-book-awards-finalists-announced/">shortlisted for the National Book Award</a>, there has been relatively little published scholarship dedicated to the novel. Thus, the students whose work is collected here have put together this casebook both to build on the academic conversation about the work, and to showcase their own original critical contributions to the field of literary scholarship. By exploring this website, we hope that you will learn more about Millet’s incredible novel, the references embedded in it, and the various themes that it confronts.<br> <br>

            In addition to the in-depth academic analyses presented here, you will also find contextual information that we feel is useful to understanding and appreciating A Children’s Bible. All the resources, information, and scholarship presented in this casebook have been generated and curated by the English 202 students themselves. A Children’s Bible: Critical Casebook takes its proud place among <a href="http://casebooks.millikinenglish.org">several other casebooks produced by students in Millikin University’s English department</a>.
